# todo-demo

Spring Server can be run from intelliji IDE. It will auto download the dependencies. <br>
React Client can be run with npm install then npm start. <br>
Server is configurated for a couchbase bucket named todo_app. It's username: database_user password:123456 <br>

Even tough I wanted to conteinerize all server,client and database environments, connecting couchbase and spring application was became unsuccessful. Nonetheless I am delivering
you the spring and docker images.<br>
Docker configuration files i used are also included in the root of the repository.
